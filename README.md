2020 has been a mentally challenging year. The millions of jobs lost due to the pandemic paired with many months of isolation have resulted in the worsening of an already dire mental health situation. According to the World Health Organization, "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted or halted critical mental health services in 93% of countries worldwide." 

With essential mental health services unavailable, many people have been left to find their own ways of coping with the losses of the pandemic. Many of these coping methods may be detrimental in the long term. 

Beacuse of this, we were inspired to create **Beacon**, a service designed to help people strengthen their mental health by promoting beneficial, creative activities. **Beacon** helps people develop meaningful and enjoyable hobbies, as studies have shown that spending time on creative hobbies during the day is associated with positive effects and psychological functioning. 

In a post-covid world, mental health will be one of the first problems we need to tackle in order to successfully recover from the pandemic. We hope that **Beacon** will act as a guiding light to this rehabilitation.
